**"High-Performance Computing (Resources and Capabilities)**\
**California State University, Northridge (CSUN)**


## Introduction/Background/Motivation

* Some $\frac{n_i}{N}$ needs are $\le$ contemporary desktop/laptop and software
  * But double-check new methodologies and growth (and by extension, movement) of data

* Some $\frac{n_j}{N}$ needs are $\gt$ contemporary desktop/laptop and software
  * Essentially, "compute-intensive, data-intensive, or network-intensive"
  * Use primarily FOSS (Linux, Open Source, etc.) to complement COTS (Windows, SPSS, etc.)

* Private, "on-premises" servers (contact: [Zack Hillbruner](mailto:zack.hillbruner@csun.edu), _CSUN IT_)
  * Usually purchased by an individual faculty member or Dept. (often with a grant or project)
  * Usually located in the on-campus CSUN MDF
  * CSUN IT usually racks and networks the system; Users manage the system and applications

* Public Cloud "free" scholars/learners (AWS, GCP, MS-Azure, OCI, Digital Ocean, etc.)
  * Use "free-tier" (still need to provide a credit card)
  * Purchase credits with a credit card

* Public Cloud "grants/credits" for scholars (AWS, GCP, MS-Azure, IBM, OCI, Digital Ocean, etc.)
  * [Cloudbank Enterprise](https://cbe.ucsd.edu/)
  * [AWS Cloud Credits for Research (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/grants/)
  * [Google AI for Science (Google)](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/ai/ai-science-forum-2024/)
  * [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/research-application-example.pdf)
  * [MS Azure Quantum Credits (Azure)](https://microsoft.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3fl9dfFrkC3g0aG?aq_source=acom)
  * [IBM Quantum Credits (IBM)](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/quantum-credits)
  * [Digital Ocean Credits (Digital Ocean)](https://www.digitalocean.com/open-source/credits-for-projects)

* Or?
  * NSF-funded, multi-year, inter-institution, STEAM/SocialSTEM, R3s/CCC's too

## General Advanced Computing/Data Management

* There are plenty of (non-HPC) advanced computing issues too (research and instruction).

* Ecosystem Transition: Compute
  * Beyond CPUs, there GPUs, FPGAs, DPUs, and others
  * COTS languages (e.g., SPSS, Stata, MPlus, Matlab, NVivo) -> FOSS languages (e.g., R, Python, Julia)
  * Single-threaded execution -> Parallel execution
  * COTS spreadsheets (e.g., Excel ) -> FOSS spreadsheets(e.g., LibreOffice).
  * Operating Systems (e.g., Windows/MacOs ) _plus_ Linux, Excel -> LibreOffice, etc.
  * Beyond replication -> Reproducibility (not just 'A' journals)

* Ecosystem Transition: Data
  * "Big Data"
  * Research results can include output data (and perhaps even source data) too
  * Desktop sizes (e.g., GiB, TiB) -> Beyond-Desktop sizes (e.g., PiB, ExiB)
  * Human-readable file formats with no meta-data (e.g., CSV) -> Digital file formats with meta-data (e.g., Parquet)
  * Row-oriented databases (e.g., MariaSQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.) -> Column-oriented databases (e.g., DuckDB, MonetDB, TileDB)
  * Monolith APIs (e.g., REST) -> Robust APIs (e.g., GraphQL)
  * Single-file access (e.g., HTTPS) -> Multi-file 'buckets' (e.g., AWS/S3, GCS, Azure/Blog)

* Ecosystem Transition: Network
  * "High Throughput"
  * Big Data needs to be moved over fast, reliable networks
  * CSUN 'Science DMZ'
  * Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) Northridge branch and Mid-Valley branch (>2x file transfer, symmetric)

* Example: Technology Trends
  * Campus Labs _plus_ Home Labs, Open Science, Open Research, Open Data, Open anything...

* I'm happy to discuss these issues too but it's not the primary focus of this material.
